# 🚗 Car Features and MSRP Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between **car features and MSRP (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price)** using Python-based data analysis techniques.  
The objective is to understand how factors such as **engine power, mileage, dimensions, and vehicle class** influence car pricing.

The project was developed as part of the **CSE101 coursework**, focusing on exploratory data analysis and data-driven insights.

## 📂 Dataset
- Dataset contains detailed specifications of cars including:
  - Engine HP
  - Engine Cylinders
  - Mileage (city & highway)
  - Vehicle Size and Class
  - MSRP
- Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed to handle missing values and outliers.

---

## 🧠 Key Analysis performed
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier detection on MSRP and engine power
- Feature-wise comparison with pricing
- Statistical summaries and visualizations

---

## 📊 Techniques & Tools Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Seaborn  

---

## 📈 Insights & Observations
- Cars with higher **engine horsepower** generally have higher MSRP
- **Luxury and performance-oriented vehicles** show significant price variation
- Outliers heavily affect average pricing and must be handled carefully
- Mileage shows an inverse relationship with MSRP in many cases
